TODOLIST for alpha-11

[ ] less matrix routes
[ ] todo stuck notes on bitwig after fixing unwanted note release on reaper, reverted
[ ] also releaseing a note by playing the same just doesn't work
[ ] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[ ] floating notes
[ ] master input (modwheel, pb + range)
[ ] portamento controls + all-osci coarse/fine
[ ] basic midi input
[ ] global set-exact-value UI (+ context menu item?)
[ ] separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override

still a bug in glfo free rand painting
global unison TODO IF we do per-voice echo, this should not be on the subvoice level
autoclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating (not on-note but continuous)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
echo -> combined reverb + multitap feedback delay (see if i can pull it off) + per-voice delay module (lets see if memory allows)
get rid of sse2neon
make better section ui esp. for the a/b/c/ sections
more context menus, clear matrix etc
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
paint something always
check all the todos before out of alpha

midi smoothing (actual midi too)
indiv param smoothing
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
multitap fb delay
rosetta is borked
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
