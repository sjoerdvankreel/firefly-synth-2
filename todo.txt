TODOLIST for alpha-21
[ ] header cleanup
[ ] recheck known issues
[ ] add qtractor to the list
[ ] do sidechain tests on new hosts
[ ] do mac tests on new hosts

TODOLIST for alpha-22 - tuning and keytracking
[ ] the ktrk is already faulty even without tuning bc it tracks literally just the key, not base pitch
[ ] filter kbd track -- should it take into account all coarse pitch mods ?
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] note filtering
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

TODOLIST for alpha-23 - rest of the gui stuff
[ ] add Carla/ardour for mac as test targets
[ ] param menu: set sliders to 10/20/25/50/75/100/150/200 whatever makes sense for the param
[ ] param menu : set to default / set to patch
[ ] fix string patch sharing samplerate bug
[ ] something with instance and patch naming
[ ] re-save everything
[ ] preset infra
[ ] import/export module
[ ] copy/paste module and patch across sessions
[ ] split large matrix dropdowns
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] do tooltips on labels ("tap dly" => tap delay)
[ ] guni voice not pick up guni voice-start automation right away (reaper)
==> display: LRX, name: Fdbk LRX, tooltip: Feedback Delay Stereo Crossover, Help: "controls the amount by which left input is fed back into the right delay line and vice versa"
==> also module superlong/tooltipname
==> "oscillator unison voice phase offset randomization", etc etc
==> display tooltip in tooltip (duh) + link to autogenerated paramreference (bundled in resources) from within the tooltip

TODOLIST for alpha-24
[ ] switch the env stage controls for MSEG editor
[ ] pop-up editor with the current stuff
[ ] env stage length edit is annoying

TODOLIST for alpha-25
[ ] theme the gui

keep profiling
PatchFromScratch video
write the manual + note about disable everything unused for performance including unused matrix slots
routing / order diagram
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pck support
per-module presets
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
take a look at the string samplerate bug again
