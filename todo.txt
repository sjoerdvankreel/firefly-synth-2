TODOLIST for alpha-19
[x] inv on the matrix source
[x] invert scale-none no workie => cannot do, need bipolar amount
[x] more bars to the audio meters
[x] drop toplevel infra
[x] drop "g.uni", just call it unison
[x] recheck the guni and modmatrix param listeners -> only on non-automatable
[x] move overlay infra to base
[x] osc mix->out not fit, go to 1280?
[x] rename ofst  to phase
[x] do graph/knob gui separate again
[ ] main /matr/guni selected store tab
[ ] do the not-in-patch thing
[ ] extsmth/rcvn => settings module, not save in patch, this later also hosts tuning settings. also move all gui settings there
[ ] not store fake params (mode::fake)
[ ] preset infra
[ ] osci phase not paint exchange state
[ ] something with instance and patch naming
[ ] import/export module
[ ] copy/paste module and patch across sessions
[ ] split large matrix dropdowns
[ ] highlight not default
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] do tooltips on labels ("tap dly" => tap delay)
[ ] guni voice not pick up guni voice-start automation right away (reaper)
==> display: LRX, name: Fdbk LRX, tooltip: Feedback Delay Stereo Crossover, Help: "controls the amount by which left input is fed back into the right delay line and vice versa"
==> "oscillator unison voice phase offset randomization", etc etc
==> display tooltip in tooltip (duh) + link to autogenerated paramreference (bundled in resources) from within the tooltip

TODOLIST for alpha-20 - tuning and keytracking
[ ] filter kbd track -- should it take into account all coarse pitch mods ?
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

TODOLIST for alpha-21
[ ] switch the env stage controls for MSEG editor
[ ] pop-up editor with the current stuff
[ ] env stage length edit is annoying

TODOLIST for alpha-22
[ ] theme the gui

decrease the build times -- recheck all the includes, forward decls, try juce into staticlib once more
write the manual + note about disable everything unused for performance including unused matrix slots
routing / order diagram
figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pck support
per-module presets
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
