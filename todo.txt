TODOLIST for alpha-10

[ ] drop matrixselectedtab
[ ] todo stuck notes on bitwig after fixing unwanted note release on reaper, reverted
[ ] also releaseing a note by playing the same just doesn't work
[ ] vgmix->mixer
[ ] optional mod indicators
[ ] do addbp also for lfos
[ ] easy access mod controls
[ ] widen the gui for the easy access stuff
[ ] make env1 to amp explicit
[ ] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[ ] paint env1 to vmix
[ ] not hardcode env1 to voice amp
[ ] floating notes
[ ] all output controls -> cpu indicator, gain indicator, need not be pretty yet
[ ] master input (aux, modwheel, pb + range)
[ ] portamento controls + all-osci coarse/fine
[ ] basic midi input
[ ] version info and firefly icon
[ ] global set-exact-value UI (+ context menu item?)
[ ] separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
[ ] MIDI key, velo (voice), low/high/last
[ ] show the version and plugformat and icon
[ ] 3x on note random as a cheap mod source, uni + normal
[x] allow lfo separate outputs as modsources, not filtered output, call it raw

still a bug in glfo free rand painting
global unison TODO IF we do per-voice echo, this should not be on the subvoice level
autoclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating (not on-note but continuous)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
echo -> combined reverb + multitap feedback delay (see if i can pull it off) + per-voice delay module (lets see if memory allows)
get rid of sse2neon
make better section ui esp. for the a/b/c/ sections
more context menus, clear matrix etc
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
paint something always
check all the todos before out of alpha
intel mac version
midi smoothing (actual midi too)
indiv param smoothing
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
multitap fb delay
