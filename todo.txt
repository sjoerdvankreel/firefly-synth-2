TODOLIST for alpha-17
[x] speed up paramAtTopo (4d vector, not a map?)
[x] keep track of active voices (perf fix)
[x] some clear/init buttons
[x] default button for multitaps
[x] on note random
[x] osc=>osci mix
[ ] decent defaults
[ ] global unison
[ ] where goes the echo
[ ] test with porta 
[ ] echo controls
[ ] place echo everywhere
[ ] echo extend/fade
[ ] basic mode
[ ] clap polymod + release as one
[ ] profile it

TODOLIST for alpha-17
[ ] switch the env stage controls for MSEG editor

TODOLIST for alpha-18
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

TODOLIST for alpha-19
[ ] preset infra
[ ] headers on the popout windows
[ ] highlight not default
[ ] env stage length edit is annoying
[ ] how the heck is the mod menu ordered?
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] save modulation as actual value not normalized + display that way too
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] show modulation amount in terms of the mod target unit for matrix and easy access
[ ] invert scale-none no workie => cannot do, need bipolar amount

TODOLIST for alpha-20
[ ] theme the gui

figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pre/post VMIX echo or not ? => NOT, bc VMIX will be on global uni subvoice level -- or will it ?
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO per voice echo should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
