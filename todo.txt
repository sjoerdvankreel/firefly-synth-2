TODOLIST for alpha-14

[x] output meters
[x] make matrix faster -> breaking change
[x] not paint modulation for disabled
[x] showmatrix to gui control
[ ] do something to clean the delay lines
[ ] make a cpu details popup
[ ] output tooltips broken
[ ] osci coarse->pitch
[ ] master modwheel + midi link
[ ] master pitch bend + midi link + range + target off/voice/oscN
[ ] external smooth into master
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS into output
[ ] voice + pitch + cent + porta off/on/auto + sync
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] floating notes
[ ] MIDI key, velo (voice), low/high/last
[ ] 3x on note random as a cheap mod source, uni + normal
[ ] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[ ] merge ui/matrix/patch
[ ] global unison with chord mode
[ ] global set-exact-value UI (+ context menu item?)
[ ] ctrl+drag for fine control

TODOLIST for alpha-15

[ ] 8x env/lfo
[ ] lower the delay smooth for vecho
[ ] make a tune before release
[ ] figure out bitwig dataexchange on linux
[ ] less matrix routes
[ ] make it clear alpha breaks the demos
[ ] allow modulate env stage lengths on voice start => any per-voice-start-automatable
[ ] keep taps on the mod matrix
[ ] master aux gui to small

pre/post VMIX echo or not ?
list all the dependencies!
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO IF we do per-voice echo, this should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating (not on-note but continuous)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
get rid of sse2neon
more context menus, clear matrix etc
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
intel mac version
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
rosetta is borked
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
