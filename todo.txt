TODOLIST for alpha-16

[x] perf fix clap exchange
[x] less matrix slots (break)
[x] insert/delete env stage
[x] assert automation timing
[x] param index/tag tooltip only for debug
[x] voice start : mark in base, not derive it (for tooltips etc since it is now acc)
[x] allow modulate env stage lengths on voice start => any per-voice-start-automatable
[x] "raw source/scale/tgt"->"source/scale/tgt"
[x] bipolar mod amt ==> into scale/source
[x] scale out of the matrix?, lo-hi or min-max into it
[x] waveshaper-like graph source / scale / target
[x] minmax in the modmatrix 
[x] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[x] modmatrix +-up/down
[x] matrix insert item
[x] matrix test clean/clear new controls
[x] implement voice target for pitchbend in voice, not osci
[ ] portamento start/end section multiplier => this needs the per-voice-start-modulation feature
[ ] make porta lead demo
[ ] 3x on note random as a cheap mod source, uni + normal
[ ] special param stuff maybe not using params but return struct from virtual?

[ ] highlight not default
[ ] how the heck is the mod menu ordered?
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] save modulation as actual value not normalized + display that way too
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] show modulation amount in terms of the mod target unit for matrix and easy access

TODOLIST for alpha-17

[ ] make a normalize button
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] make a percussion demo
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] global unison with chord mode
[ ] figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

make a tune before release
pre/post VMIX echo or not ? => NOT, bc VMIX will be on global uni subvoice level -- or will it ?
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO per voice echo should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
