TODOLIST for alpha-17
[x] speed up paramAtTopo (4d vector, not a map?)
[x] keep track of active voices (perf fix)
[x] some clear/init buttons
[x] default button for multitaps
[x] on note random
[x] osc=>osci mix (breaking by defaults)
[x] where goes the echo
[x] echo controls
[x] place echo everywhere
[x] echo extend/fade
[x] test with porta 
[x] the vecho buffers are not reset? -- oh its the filters, check global too? also check all fxs
[x] do IN/OUT VAMP
[x] flip filter/lrx in the popup taps
[x] global->voice matrix was slow
[x] lpf/hpf on/off for all echo filters => breaking + connect the dsp
[x] switch echo gui position
[x] osci mod labels broken
[x] vecho not extend osci+fx
[x] vecho recheck simd options
[x] profile the vecho
[x] new optype remap
[x] show mod in overlay screens
[x] amp not work like this, needs unipolar, like osci gain
[x] make stuff bipolar in the gui => new paramtype identityBipolar
[x] more uni controls: vmix, voice_module
[x] see what else can benefit from bipolar identity (now say that without context) ==> env slope
[x] osci phase (lfo phase?) needs exchange for global uni
[x] also better marksection for the multitap
[x] make graphs for the guni
[x] basic/full mode needs per-param
[x] conditional disable edit button
[x] basic mode
[x] check perf & graph perf
[x] select the target graph
[x] do paint as disabled
[x] exchange paint no workie
[x] upcast to FBPlugGUI in graph no longer works
[x] refix the demos
[x] hunt the todos
[x] decent defaults
[x] merge knobmod/graph into visuals
[ ] clap polymod + release as one
[ ] global unison
[ ] lfo also need phase exchange
[ ] osci-target vecho demo
[ ] global uni demo
[ ] profile some more

TODOLIST for alpha-17
[ ] switch the env stage controls for MSEG editor
[ ] pop-up editor with the current stuff

TODOLIST for alpha-18 - tuning and keytracking
[ ] filter kbd track -- should it take into account all coarse pitch mods ?
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

TODOLIST for alpha-19
[ ] split large matrix dropdowns
[ ] preset infra
[ ] check all linear horizontal + do sensitivity for linear horizontal
[ ] headers on the popout windows
[ ] highlight not default
[ ] env stage length edit is annoying
[ ] how the heck is the mod menu ordered?
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] save modulation as actual value not normalized + display that way too
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] show modulation amount in terms of the mod target unit for matrix and easy access
[ ] invert scale-none no workie => cannot do, need bipolar amount

TODOLIST for alpha-20
[ ] theme the gui

routing / order diagram
figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pre/post VMIX echo or not ? => NOT, bc VMIX will be on global uni subvoice level -- or will it ?
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO per voice echo should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
