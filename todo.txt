TODOLIST for beta-next
[ ] note renoise is very dangerous

[ ] do more themes
[ ] dump topo should include the tags and indices, for debugging renoise
[ ] wrap up all the patch browser stuff into a single GH issue
[ ] unify load patch/load preset
[ ] single-click preview patch without actually loading it => this goes into the fancy patch browser
[ ] do something with the dont-know-how-i-got-here-patch
[ ] autofill the last tweaked => too complicated, is for later
[ ] rename demo to featuretest
[ ] also brag about its faster
[ ] brag about superior visualization and note when it not works (ardour everywhere, Linux only reaper is good, clap always good, vst3 win/lin mostly good)
[ ] also brag about the tuning
[ ] just do the comparison
[ ] featuretest scheme
[ ] bg images in main tabs and header and maybe elsewhere
[ ] not right-click-change horizontal sliders
[ ] rename demo to feature test
[ ] make some presets
[ ] compare to ff1
[ ] all the GitHub preview stuff and archive the old repos and do the website and the kvr stuff and whatnot

make Carla bug report for stuck notes (but verify its not me, first)
arpeggiator
keep profiling
recheck known issues
add qtractor to the list
dedicated distortion module
do sidechain tests on new hosts
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pck support
per-module presets
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override

string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
take a look at the string samplerate bug again
guni voice not pick up guni voice-start automation right away (reaper)
split large matrix dropdowns
