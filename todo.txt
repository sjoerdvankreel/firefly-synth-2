[ ] unify load patch/load preset
[ ] autofill the last tweaked => too complicated, is for later
[ ] wrap up all the patch browser stuff into a single GH issue
[ ] single-click preview patch without actually loading it => this goes into the fancy patch browser

TODOLIST for beta-next
[ ] list the relevant folders in the GH page
[ ] do more themes
[ ] dump topo should include the tags and indices, for debugging renoise
[ ] just do the comparison to FF1
[ ] bg images in main tabs and header and maybe elsewhere
[ ] not right-click-change horizontal sliders
[ ] make some presets
[ ] all the GitHub preview stuff and archive the old repos and do the website and the kvr stuff and whatnot
