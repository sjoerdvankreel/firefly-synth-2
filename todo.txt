TODOLIST for alpha-16

[ ] assert automationtiming
[ ] param index/tag tooltip only for debug
[ ] default to if-focus ?
[ ] voice start : mark in base, not derive it (for tooltips etc since it is now acc)
[ ] move flush audio to somewhere else
[ ] how the heck is the mod menu ordered?
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] implement voice target for pitchbend in voice, not osci
[ ] envelope should loop at very last ?
[ ] portamento start/end section multiplier => this needs the per-voice-start-modulation feature
[ ] make porta lead demo
[ ] scale out of the matrix?, lo-hi or min-max into it
[ ] waveshaper-like graph source / scale / target
[ ] minmax in the modmatrix 
[ ] special param stuff maybe not using params but return struct from virtual?
[ ] save modulation as actual value not normalized + display that way too
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] 3x on note random as a cheap mod source, uni + normal
[ ] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] show modulation amount in terms of the mod target unit for matrix and easy access
[ ] allow modulate env stage lengths on voice start => any per-voice-start-automatable

TODOLIST for alpha-17

[ ] make a normalize button
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] make a percussion demo
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] global unison with chord mode
[ ] figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

make a tune before release
pre/post VMIX echo or not ? => NOT, bc VMIX will be on global uni subvoice level -- or will it ?
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO per voice echo should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
