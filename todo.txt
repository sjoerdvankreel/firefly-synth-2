drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
still a bug in glfo free rand painting
global unison TODO IF we do per-voice echo, this should not be on the subvoice level
autoclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating (not on-note but continuous)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
echo -> combined reverb + multitap feedback delay (see if i can pull it off) + per-voice delay module (lets see if memory allows)
get rid of sse2neon
make better section ui esp. for the a/b/c/ sections
more context menus, clear matrix etc
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
paint something always
