TODOLIST for alpha-18
[x] recheck audio input in plug mode => needs cache clear / rescan
[x] in global section
[x] do midi-receive yesno, default 1/0 for inst/fx
[x] fx/inst + other guid
[x] check the defaults
[x] do the xchange data
[x] show in header
[ ] shareable patches?
[ ] as osci
[ ] test the clap
[ ] loads of host test files

TODOLIST for alpha-19 - tuning and keytracking
[ ] filter kbd track -- should it take into account all coarse pitch mods ?
[ ] make a dedicated tuning section with some options
[ ] need per-instance params for microtuning
[ ] note filtering
[ ] tune the filters
[ ] figure out all places where is used midi note
[ ] MTS into master: off / note / continuous 
[ ] MTS take into account all pitch modulators (eg pitchbend + 1 must be +1 semitones of the retuned scale, also for all coarse/fine, unison, etc etc)
[ ] filters should track the actual pitch when possible (string osci)

TODOLIST for alpha-20
[ ] make the popouts moveable top level windows + also the matrix
[ ] switch the env stage controls for MSEG editor
[ ] pop-up editor with the current stuff
[ ] import/export module
[ ] copy/paste module and patch across sessions
[ ] split large matrix dropdowns
[ ] preset infra
[ ] check all linear horizontal + do sensitivity for linear horizontal
[ ] headers on the popout windows
[ ] highlight not default
[ ] env stage length edit is annoying
[ ] how the heck is the mod menu ordered?
[ ] do display disabled/impossible items different in the mod matrix
[ ] save modulation as actual value not normalized + display that way too
[ ] bright text when graph on
[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] show visual clue if knob is being modulated
[ ] show modulation amount in terms of the mod target unit for matrix and easy access
[ ] invert scale-none no workie => cannot do, need bipolar amount

TODOLIST for alpha-21
[ ] theme the gui

write the manual + note about disable everything unused for performance including unused matrix slots
routing / order diagram
figure out bitwig dataexchange on Linux
make a percussion demo
make porta lead demo
make a tune before release
pre/post VMIX echo or not ? => NOT, bc VMIX will be on global uni subvoice level -- or will it ?
pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO per voice echo should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating optional (on-note and continuous both)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
