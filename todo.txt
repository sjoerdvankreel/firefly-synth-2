alph 13 - vecho

[ ] get the text out of the graphs
[ ] vecho -- how with global uni? share delay line between 8 taps / + 1 fdbck line, no modulation -> cannot place anywhere in the pipeline but thats ok

TODOLIST for alpha-14

[ ] make a tune before release
[ ] figure out bitwig dataexchange on linux
[ ] less matrix routes
[ ] floating notes
[ ] master input (modwheel, pb + range) + easy-access midi somehow
[ ] portamento controls + all-osci coarse/fine
[ ] global set-exact-value UI (+ context menu item?)
[ ] MIDI key, velo (voice), low/high/last
[ ] 3x on note random as a cheap mod source, uni + normal
[ ] make it clear alpha breaks the demos
[ ] allow modulate env stage lengths on voice start
[ ] keep taps on the mod matrix
[ ] refix all behind-the-scenes mod sources and targets
[ ] master aux gui to small

pck support
per-module presets
external audio input
separate midi, bpm, automation smoothing, auto should be global + per-param override
drop+recreate all the demos before going rc (not allow breaking changes anymore)
drop all the conversion before going beta/rc
global unison TODO IF we do per-voice echo, this should not be on the subvoice level
autosoftclip
MTS-ESP (check with SST again, go with the osci only? or filters and stuff as well?) in any case make it floating (not on-note but continuous)
another round of cpu and memory profiling
factory presets
echo -> combined reverb + multitap feedback delay (see if i can pull it off) + per-voice delay module (lets see if memory allows)
get rid of sse2neon
more context menus, clear matrix etc
string timbre should not react to samplerate/oversample
check all the todos before out of alpha
intel mac version
fix todos
todo document the thing a bit
multitap fb delay
rosetta is borked
vst3 note expr + midi mpe
explain processing order and modulation order including auto/external/internal
