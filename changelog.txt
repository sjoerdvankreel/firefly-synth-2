June 18, 2025 - alpha 5.

- Modules
* Merged string osci into regular osci.
* Added per-voice audio mixer matrix (no global yet, that's still fixed routing).
* Known issue: segfaults on Linux+Bitwig+CLAP. This combination seems always difficult, i will not pursue it untill beta. (Linux+Reaper is good, Linux+Bitwig+VST3 is good).

June 14, 2025 - alpha 4.

- Core
* Turned up the warning levels for all compilers (/W4 -Wall).

- Modules
* Merged the osci and string osci graphs.
* Merged all env graphs into 1.

June 11, 2025 - alpha 3.

- Core
* Cache JUCE FFT instance.
* Keep track of last incoming MIDI key (in case of chord this is "whatever").
* Reworked the infra a bit to allow for modules that are both global and per-voice.

- Modules
* Add global FX.
* Separate comb+/comb-/both filters. Just a performance tweak.
* New FX param (global only): smoothing last MIDI key. Smooths filter freq jumps when keytracking global filters.

June 10, 2025 - alpha 2.

- Build
* Update GH windows runners.
* Build scripts now zip the artifacts again.
* Fix build script error for release builds (resources weren't being copied).

- Core
* Split out VST3 and CLAP logs.
* Fixed some vertical text layout errors on Linux.
* Compiles and runs on Windows/Linux/MacOS. Ubuntu22+, Mac ARM only, no Intel.
* Added more detailed logging, including in the case of an unhandled exception.
* Fixed a bug where locale-independent parsing was assumed (std::strtod), broke on Linux.
* Fixed a bug in VST3 data exchange alignment which caused visualization to not work on MacOS.

June 4, 2025 - alpha 1.

- Core
* Clap polyphonic modulation support.
* Visualization directly from audio engine.

- Modules
* Envelopes, per-voice fx, string osci, osci + mod matrix.
