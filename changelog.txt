August 22, 2025 - Alpha 12.

- Core
* Add memory pool for recycling and on-demand allocation.
* Really this thing is just here so you don't pay the price of allocating delay lines when not using them.

- Modules
* Add global echo module (multitap delay + feedback delay + reverb).

August 15, 2025 - Alpha 11.

- Core
* MIDI: support CLAP MIDI note dialect.
* MIDI: allow access to CC/Channel Pressure/Pitch Bend (mod matrix only for now).
* Bugfix: active voice was not retriggered by the same note key.

- UI
* Moved MIDI and automation smoothing control to separate module.
* Add more info to graph plots (e.g. "Osc 1 FM", "Osc 2 String", "LFO 1A Saw", "VFX 1A Clip").
* Add dedicated tab header area for module type (e.g. "Osc", "1, "2" instead of "Osc 1", "2").

- Modules
* Increased MIDI/automation smoothing max from 50 to 200ms.
* LFO: added gaussian counterparts to uniform random and uniform smooth random generators.
* Bugfix: LFO free-running random was not actually free running.
* Bugfix: LFO free-running random and smooth random plotted the graph incorrect, simplified.

August 9, 2025 - Alpha 10.

- Core
* Made visual mod indicators optional.
* Bugfix - made sure default param value is always valid.

- UI
* Group related parameter sections together.
* Activate graph plot on click, not only change. 
* Remove osci/fx slot number from parts of the mixer UI.
* Display icon/version/plug type (VST3/CLAP)/build type (X64/ARM).

- Modules
* Add dedicated voice-amp envelope.
* Add more output parameters (cpu, gain).
* Add master auxiliary parameters like FF1, use through mod matrix.
* Add bipolar modulation types to LFO subslots to match the mod matrix.
* Increased envelope segment count to 12 (honestly just b/c spare UI space).
* Each LFO subslot now has individual phase control.
* LFO A/B/C subslots are now accessible as additional mod sources in the matrix.
* Added a bunch of easy-access modulation controls that work on top of the mod matrix. Mod order is now 1) host automation, 2) CLAP host modulation, 3) mod matrix, 4) easy-access controls.
** Dedicated amp env to VMix amp (was already there, just made it explicit)
** VLFO1 -> VMix balance
** GLFO1 -> GMix amp
** GLFO2 -> GMix balance
** Env N -> Osci N gain
** VLFO N -> Osci N fine pitch
** GLFO 1/2/3/4 -> GFX A/B/C/D control parameter (stvar/cmb filter frq or shaper gain)
** Env 1/2/3/4 and VLFO 1/2/3/4 -> VFX A/B/C/D control parameter (stvar/cmb filter frq or shaper gain)

July 27, 2025 - alpha 9.

- Modules
* Increased env and lfo count to 6.
* Add global and per-voice mod matrix.

July 14, 2025 - alpha 8.

- Modules
* Add global and per-voice lfo.
* Just for fun, VLFO1 temporarily adds to osci 1 gain and GLFO1 adds to osci 2 gain (since, no modmatrix yet).

July 2, 2025 - alpha 7.

- Build
* Opt into ASAN builds.
* Opt out of warn-as-error.

- Core
* Add undo/redo support.
* Checkboxes are now centered.
* Add patch load/save/init support.
* Bugfix: tooltips were not showing for comboboxes.
* Selected tabs are now remembered across sessions.
* Add conversion (old serialized-to-disk format) support.
* Add "clear module"/"copy module to" context menu items.
* Bugfix: last MIDI note was tracking note-off events (and on, both).
* Voice envelope start position now snaps to 4 (actually floats-per-simd-register) samples instead of fixed block size (16).

June 23, 2025 - alpha 6.

- Core
* Bugfix: osci graph l/r was swapped.

- Modules
* Added global audio mixer matrix.
* Added panning control to osci.
* Added stereo balancing control to audio mixer matrices.
* String osci: soft clip if it gets really loud.
* String osci: dropped keytracking range, now fixed to +/-2 oct like everything else.
* String osci: fixed buffer overflow in graph painting.
* "Suddenly" Linux+Bitwig+CLAP starts working again! ;) Need to figure out a way to integrate asan into the workflow.

June 18, 2025 - alpha 5.

- Modules
* Merged string osci into regular osci.
* Added per-voice audio mixer matrix (no global yet, that's still fixed routing).
* Known issue: segfaults on Linux+Bitwig+CLAP. This combination seems always difficult, i will not pursue it untill beta. (Linux+Reaper is good, Linux+Bitwig+VST3 is good).

June 14, 2025 - alpha 4.

- Core
* Turned up the warning levels for all compilers (/W4 -Wall).

- Modules
* Merged the osci and string osci graphs.
* Merged all env graphs into 1.

June 11, 2025 - alpha 3.

- Core
* Cache JUCE FFT instance.
* Keep track of last incoming MIDI key (in case of chord this is "whatever").
* Reworked the infra a bit to allow for modules that are both global and per-voice.

- Modules
* Add global FX.
* Separate comb+/comb-/both filters. Just a performance tweak.
* New FX param (global only): smoothing last MIDI key. Smooths filter freq jumps when keytracking global filters.

June 10, 2025 - alpha 2.

- Build
* Update GH windows runners.
* Build scripts now zip the artifacts again.
* Fix build script error for release builds (resources weren't being copied).

- Core
* Split out VST3 and CLAP logs.
* Fixed some vertical text layout errors on Linux.
* Compiles and runs on Windows/Linux/MacOS. Ubuntu22+, Mac ARM only, no Intel.
* Added more detailed logging, including in the case of an unhandled exception.
* Fixed a bug where locale-independent parsing was assumed (std::strtod), broke on Linux.
* Fixed a bug in VST3 data exchange alignment which caused visualization to not work on MacOS.

June 4, 2025 - alpha 1.

- Core
* Clap polyphonic modulation support.
* Visualization directly from audio engine.

- Modules
* Envelopes, per-voice fx, string osci, osci + mod matrix.
