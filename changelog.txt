October 29, 2025 - Alpha 20.

- Build:
* Moved JUCE into a static library so it doesn't build 4 times.

- Other:
* Bugfix: some hosts do not provide the VST3 exchange data, deal with it. This crashed the GUI on Linux+Bitwig/Carla/Renoise. Also solves painting problems on other hosts.
* Bugfix: Ardour does not call VST3's Connect() before Activate(). Don't know if that's allowed or not - deal with it.

- Testing efforts:
* Added Carla and Ardour to the standard test set (VST3 only, Win/Lin only for now).

October 27, 2025 - Alpha 19.

- Modules:
* Matrix: add "invert source" option.
* Global unison: bugfix, graph plots are now only switched by user interaction, not automation.
* Master "external smoothing" and "receive notes" parameters moved to new Settings module. Saved per-session, not per-patch.

- UI:
* Went slightly bigger to accommodate UI changes.
* Brushed up the graph plots a bit, look more pretty now.
* GUI settings now have their own dedicated screen space.
* New GUI option: highlight parameters that divert from their default value.
* New GUI option: highlight modulation bounds on sliders. This takes into account modmatrix and easy-access controls, but not global unison or CLAP host modulation.

October 15, 2025 - Alpha 18.

- Core
* Add FX version of the plug, patches can be shared between FX/instrument (they are 99.9% the same).
* Instrument version now supports sidechain input (if your host supports it).

- Modules:
* GMix now allows routing external audio.
* Osci can now run external audio so you can use it for FM etc.
* Master now has a "receive notes yes/no" switch for those hosts that allow sending MIDI notes to FX plugins.

October 08, 2025 - Alpha 17.

- Core
* Some more performance improvements.

- UI
* Merged "show mod indicator details" and "show graph details" into 1 control.

- VMix
* The main voice amp envelope can now be placed anywhere in the voice processing pipeline (was necessary to work with per-voice echo).
* Add an intermediate "Osci Mixer" stage to allow grouping multiple osci's together and allow per-voice echo on that group. (Breaking change).

- Matrix:
* Performance fix: global-to-voice modulation was slow.
* New on-note (VNote) sources: 3x per-group-random-uniform and 3x gaussian. These have the same value for all voices in a global unison group.
* New modulation types "phase wrap" and "remap". Phase wrap just adds modulator to target, folds back into [0..1]. Remap: at 0.5 it does nothing,
at 0.4 it maps [0 1] onto [0 0.8] and at 0.7 it maps [0 1] onto [0.4 1]. These were needed for global unison but now also available in the mod matrix
and the LFO's.

- Echo:
* Added clear/init buttons for the multitap editor.
* Performance fix + breaking change: all LP/HP filters now have a toggle button to enable them.
* Performance fix: per-voice echo lifetime extension of the voice kept running the oscillators (oops).
* Per-voice echo can now be placed anywhere in the pipeline (target a single osci/fx, subset of oscis, or the entire voice).

- Global unison (new module)
* Up to 8 voices.
* 38 per-voice target parameters. Subset of all possible osci, lfo, fx, envelope and voice echo knobs.
* Per-parameter selection of automatic or manual modulation mode.
* Manual: build up the voice spectrum by hand, with 8 (max global uni voices) controls per target parameter (all 38).
* Automatic mode: spread, skew, and randomize controls to build up the voice spectrum.
* Per-parameter selection of modulation type (how to apply the spectrum to the individual voices), same options as mod matrix.
* All controls (both manual and automatic modes) fully modulatable, so the entire global unison module can be controlled by the matrix.
* Tiny per-parameter graph that shows the voice spectrum.

September 17, 2025 - Alpha 16.

- Core
* Only show parameter tag and index in debug mode.
* Performance fix: CLAP data exchange (processor to controller for GUI graphs) was slow.

- GUI
* Envelope: context menu items for insert/remove stage.
* Matrix: add insert/remove/up/down buttons for each route.
* Matrix: show a couple graphs to get a feeling for what a modulation route is doing. These are based on static "example" data, not realtime from the engine (that would basically require to calculate the entire synth state to plot it).

- Modules:
* Matrix: decreased slot count (breaking change).
* Matrix: add lo/hi controls for source. These are not really modulators but rather "a statement of truth": If you *know* the mod source is always between 40-60% normalized, set those values and the source will be remapped unto 0..1. Use case: MIDI key range 0..127 as a mod source.
* Matrix: scale is now "always on". Select "None" for a continuous 100% signal.
* Matrix: scale now has min/max control parameters. Set min > max for an inverted signal.
* VNote: add 6 new mod sources: 3x on-note-random-uniform, 3x on-note-random-gaussian.
* Voice module: add (enabled) attack/release section time multipliers on the amp envelope. Use case: play abc-pause-def as portamento sections, shorten attack times of bcef, shorten release times of abde. I use it to fake monophonic mode (which i dont want to re-implement, it's the buggiest thing in FF1) for leads.
* Allow on-voice-start-modulation of a tiny subset of parameters. These params are really block-based, but they now react (sample accurate) to CLAP modulation and internal modulators both, at voice-sample-start-position. Use case: throw some randomness at voice amp stage 0 (for note delays).

September 08, 2025 - Alpha 15.

- Support Intel Mac.
- Drop dependency on sse2neon.
- Update all dependencies to latest.

September 06, 2025 - Alpha 14.

- Core
* New button to flush all delay lines (manual action) + auto-triggered on patch change.
* MTS-ESP: not yet. There's a checkbox that shows if a master is connected. There's a tuning mode selection in the master module, but it's disabled.

- UI
* Changed output parameter labels to meters.
* Add exact-value editor tracking the last tweaked parameter.
* Hide/show matrix state is now saved within the host project.
* Bugfix: don't paint modulation status for disabled parameters.
* Bugfix: tooltips for output parameters where broken for CLAP. Just disabled them.

- Modules
* Bugfix: on-note modulators were one (internal) block (16 samples) behind.
* Breaking change: set env/lfo count to 6 again + added some new easy-access modulation controls.
* Breaking change: coarse pitch controls now range from -128 to +128 (so, you can finally do kicks).
* Breaking change + performance fix: it is now necessary to manually specify the slot count for the mod matrix.

- Modules
* New master mod sources pitchbend and modwheel.
* New master param: mod wheel. Only to be used through the mod matrix.
* New master params: pitch bend + bend range + bend target (off, all osci, single osci).
* Master PB and modwheel are by default (init patch) modulated by their corresponding midi parameters (so, non-destructive).
* New mod source: GNote (global note stream). Tracks last/low-key/low-velocity/high-key/high-velocity notes and provides key and velocity value for them as [0..100%].

- Modules
* New per-voice module params: all-osci coarse/fine pitch + easy-access modulators.
* New per-voice module params: portamento + specify glide length in time or bars.
** NO monophonic mode, and probably never will be.
** Like FF1, select off, on (constant pitch, variable time), auto (constant time, variable pitch).
** Like FF1, select always or "section" mode (only when previous note has not received note-off event yet).
** Section mode has 2 disabled params for now (amp attack/release), plan is to connect those to all but the first/last note in portamento section.
* New mod source: VNote (whatever triggered the voice). Key and velocity.
* VNote velocity by default (init patch) maps to VMix amp.

August 25, 2025 - Alpha 13.

- Modules
* Add new per-voice echo module.
* Add new global echo target: after GFX but before GMix.
* Bugfix: global echo used a full-blown delay line per tap which is not necessary, cut down on memory usage.
* Bugfix: error in the mod matrix which caused the modulation signal to be delayed by 1 block and probably other stuff.

August 22, 2025 - Alpha 12.

- Core
* Add memory pool for recycling and on-demand allocation.
* Really this thing is just here so you don't pay the price of allocating delay lines when not using them.

- Modules
* Add global echo module (multitap delay + feedback delay + reverb).

August 15, 2025 - Alpha 11.

- Core
* MIDI: support CLAP MIDI note dialect.
* MIDI: allow access to CC/Channel Pressure/Pitch Bend (mod matrix only for now).
* Bugfix: active voice was not retriggered by the same note key.

- UI
* Moved MIDI and automation smoothing control to separate module.
* Add more info to graph plots (e.g. "Osc 1 FM", "Osc 2 String", "LFO 1A Saw", "VFX 1A Clip").
* Add dedicated tab header area for module type (e.g. "Osc", "1, "2" instead of "Osc 1", "2").

- Modules
* Increased MIDI/automation smoothing max from 50 to 200ms.
* LFO: added gaussian counterparts to uniform random and uniform smooth random generators.
* Bugfix: LFO free-running random was not actually free running.
* Bugfix: LFO free-running random and smooth random plotted the graph incorrect, simplified.

August 9, 2025 - Alpha 10.

- Core
* Made visual mod indicators optional.
* Bugfix - made sure default param value is always valid.

- UI
* Group related parameter sections together.
* Activate graph plot on click, not only change. 
* Remove osci/fx slot number from parts of the mixer UI.
* Display icon/version/plug type (VST3/CLAP)/build type (X64/ARM).

- Modules
* Add dedicated voice-amp envelope.
* Add more output parameters (cpu, gain).
* Add master auxiliary parameters like FF1, use through mod matrix.
* Add bipolar modulation types to LFO subslots to match the mod matrix.
* Increased envelope segment count to 12 (honestly just b/c spare UI space).
* Each LFO subslot now has individual phase control.
* LFO A/B/C subslots are now accessible as additional mod sources in the matrix.
* Added a bunch of easy-access modulation controls that work on top of the mod matrix. Mod order is now 1) host automation, 2) CLAP host modulation, 3) mod matrix, 4) easy-access controls.
** Dedicated amp env to VMix amp (was already there, just made it explicit)
** VLFO1 -> VMix balance
** GLFO1 -> GMix amp
** GLFO2 -> GMix balance
** Env N -> Osci N gain
** VLFO N -> Osci N fine pitch
** GLFO 1/2/3/4 -> GFX A/B/C/D control parameter (stvar/cmb filter frq or shaper gain)
** Env 1/2/3/4 and VLFO 1/2/3/4 -> VFX A/B/C/D control parameter (stvar/cmb filter frq or shaper gain)

July 14, 2025 - alpha 8.

- Modules

* Selected tabs are now remembered across sessions.
* Add conversion (old serialized-to-disk format) support.
* Add "clear module"/"copy module to" context menu items.
* Bugfix: last MIDI note was tracking note-off events (and on, both).
* Voice envelope start position now snaps to 4 (actually floats-per-simd-register) samples instead of fixed block size (16).

June 23, 2025 - alpha 6.

- Core
* Bugfix: osci graph l/r was swapped.

- Modules
* Added global audio mixer matrix.
* Added panning control to osci.
* Added stereo balancing control to audio mixer matrices.
* String osci: soft clip if it gets really loud.
* String osci: dropped keytracking range, now fixed to +/-2 oct like everything else.
* String osci: fixed buffer overflow in graph painting.
* "Suddenly" Linux+Bitwig+CLAP starts working again! ;) Need to figure out a way to integrate asan into the workflow.

June 18, 2025 - alpha 5.

- Modules
* Merged string osci into regular osci.
* Added per-voice audio mixer matrix (no global yet, that's still fixed routing).
* Known issue: segfaults on Linux+Bitwig+CLAP. This combination seems always difficult, i will not pursue it untill beta. (Linux+Reaper is good, Linux+Bitwig+VST3 is good).

* Reworked the infra a bit to allow for modules that are both global and per-voice.

- Modules
* Add global FX.
* Separate comb+/comb-/both filters. Just a performance tweak.
