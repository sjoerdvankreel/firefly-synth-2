FF1 and FF2 are pretty much the same in spirit, and they share a lot of algorithms on the DSP side.<br/>
Nevertheless, both are different enough that I felt a new version was warranted, and they cannot share patches either.

# The Just-Different
Stuff that both can do, just in different ways.

# The Bad
Stuff that FF1 can do, and FF2 can NOT do.

* No arpeggiator.<br/>
This actually feels like a real miss, might rebuild.
* No stereo balance for audio mixers (VMix/GMix).<br/>
Just gain only, didn't see the need for balancing.
* No multi-EQ module.<br/>
Pretty sure it does not belong in a general-purpose synth, won't rebuild.<br/>
You can still stack multiple BPF/shelving filters, but more tedious.
* No dedicated distortion module.<br/>
Would like to have it, might rebuild.<br/>
The new multi-slot effect modules allow to build something like it manually, but more tedious.
* No separate smoothing controls for MIDI, BPM, and automation.<br/>
On the radar, but i don't know how important it is.<br/>
FF2 only has 1 global option for all 3 together.<br/>
If-ever, i prefer separate controls for individual automatable parameters and maybe even MIDI CC's.
* No bipolar and/or split envelope segments.<br/>
Just linear and unipolar exponential, I just didn't see the need for the other ones anymore (might reconsider, convince me).
* No monophonic mode, period.<br/>
I also do not intend to build it back, because too complicated.<br/>
FF2 does contain new section-attack/section-release shortening controls to emulate those short transitions for leads etc.<br/>
If you want a monosynth, get a proper monosynth. By now I feel they are different enough to not try and force one into a polysynth.
