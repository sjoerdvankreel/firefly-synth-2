FF1 and FF2 are pretty much the same in spirit, and they share a lot of algorithms on the DSP side.<br/>
Nevertheless, both are different enough that I felt a new version was warranted, and they cannot share patches either.

# The Bad
Let's just start with the stuff that FF1 can do, and FF2 can NOT do.

* Multi-EQ module:<br/>
Didn't rebuild it.<br/>
Also doubting if it even belongs in a general-purpose synth.<br/>
You can still stack multiple BPF/shelving filters, but more tedious.
* Dedicated distortion module:<br/>
FF2 doesn't have one, but it's on the radar.<br/>
The new multi-slot effect modules allow to build something like it manually, but again more tedious.
* Separate smoothing controls for MIDI, BPM, and automation:<br/>
Also on the radar, but i don't know how important it is.<br/>
FF2 only has 1 global option for all 3 together.<br/>
If-ever, i prefer separate controls for individual automatable parameters and maybe even MIDI CC's.
